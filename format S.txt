= Format S =

Data format for storing text strings. The rationale is that sometimes you want to store lots of strings in a file or database efficiently. This data format is probably as compact as it can get without using null-terminated strings, which are costly to skip through. This format uses length encoding, and this data format could conceivable be directly memory-mapped. One example use case is a translation table.

== Overview ==

Like: width (1), count (width), string pointers (length * count * 2), string data (?)

 {
 	# header - dimensions
 	width [1] 
 	count [width] 
	# header - array of "pointers"
 	string_pointers [count] {
 		offset [width]
 		length [width] # length of bytes, not character count
 	}

	# raw string data
 	strings []
 }

* header

* raw string data

=== Header ===

The number of strings and then a list of pairs of offsets and lengths into the rest of the data, relative to the beginning of the file

=== Raw string data ===

Strings are packed back-to-back, and there are no null terminators because the strings are length encoded in the header
